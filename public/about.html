<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! My name is Marcos Reyes, I'm a recent computer science graduate from the University of the Pacific trying to figure out what I specifically want to do with my CS degree.
  I've been exposed to a variety of CS fields such as software engineering, web development, cybersecurity, machine learning, and video game development. I have practice programming
  in Java, Python, C, C#, and other languages. Right now I'm taking a web development Bootcamp on Udemy to see if that is what I want to pursue. It was between that or data science
  since I do enjoy statistics. Right now I'm working with Court Technology Services over at the Judicial Branch of Maricopa County in Arizona. There I'm doing quality assurance
  but trying to expose myself to some software projects that the development team is doing. I'm open to learning and to have any mentors along the way. So if you stumbled on this website,
  hi and feel free to reach out.</p>
