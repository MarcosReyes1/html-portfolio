<h1>The Best Movies According to Marcos</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time. (no specific order)</h2>
<hr />
<h3>A Clockwork Orange</h3>
<p>It is hard to watch but it tackles really solid themes like 
crime, class divide, and psychological practices.
</p>
<h3>Spiderman: Across the Spider-Verse</h3>
<p>Amazing animation and one of the best sequels out there.</p>
<h3>The Conjuring</h3>
<p>Good horror movie, not a lot of jumpscares and gets the job done.</p>
